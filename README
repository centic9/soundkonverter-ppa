This is a release candidate of soundKonverter 1.0.0
At this stage there shouldn't be any bugs any more. Unfortunately there are most likely some left. So if you see one, call me.
soundKonverter >should< be stable and harmless but that is not guaranteed.

You can either leave a comment at http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=29024
or write me a mail to hessijames@gmail.com
but the best way is to create a bug report/ask a question at https://bugs.launchpad.net/soundkonverter
